A **React-based web application** for managing bowling bookings with dynamic animations, responsive forms, and state management using Zustand. The app includes a seamless user flow from a loading screen to booking confirmation, enhanced with Framer Motion animations.

## Features

### üïí **Loading Page**
- A visually engaging loading screen with a flame animation built using Framer Motion.
- Transitions smoothly to the booking page after a few seconds.

### üé≥ **Booking Page**
- A booking form that allows users to:
  - Select **date** and **time**.
  - Specify the **number of bowlers** and **lanes**.
  - Assign **shoe sizes** for each bowler.
- Real-time form validation:
  - Ensures no more than 4 bowlers per lane.
  - Verifies valid shoe sizes for all players.
- Uses Zustand for global state management to handle:
  - Booking details (`useStore`).
  - Confirmation states (`useConfirmationStore`).

### üåê **API Integration**
- Submits booking data as JSON via a POST request to an external API.
- Error handling for failed requests, with descriptive messages for the user.

### üåà **Animations**
- Page transitions and element animations powered by **Framer Motion**:
  - Fade-in/out and sliding transitions between pages.
  - Staggered animation for fire effects.
  - Real-time reactive animations based on user interactions.
